Foo has_many Bar - AAP
Xx has_many Yy - AAA

Reasons to hate AAP
1. It has an inconsistent interface
See tests in foo_test.rb

2. It is not atomic
see tests in foo_test.rb
lib/caboose/acts/paranoid.rb
  def recover!
    self.deleted_at = nil
    save!
  end
   
  def recover_with_associations!(*associations)
    self.recover!
    associations.to_a.each do |assoc|
      self.send(assoc).find_with_deleted(:all).each do |a|
        a.recover! if a.class.paranoid?
      end
    end
  end

4. The code is really complicated
lib/caboose/acts/paranoid_find_wrapper.rb

5. Using the code is really complicated
See my examples above

6. It fucks with find, destroy, and delete.  This will screw you, immediately, or when it's really important. Additionally, everyone needs on your team needs to know how and why it's screwing with these methods, or they will screw everyone.

7. Annoying
f = Foo.first
f.destroy
f.recover! #ERRRORRRRROR, Wesley
Foo.find_with_deleted(:all).first.recover!

Foo.all_with_deleted doesn't exist
Foo.first_with_deleted doesn't exist
etc.


Reasons to love AAA
1. It's consistent

2. It has a simple interface
See xx_test
4 class methods added, 3 instance methods added

3. Atomic
you won't unarchive associations unintentionally

4. Our documentation isn't "Read the code"
Srsly, check out that README

Reasons to hate AAA
1. The code is still pretty complicated
/lib/expected_behavior/acts_as_archival.rb
